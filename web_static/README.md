ALX 0x01 - AirBnB Clone: Web Static
Welcome to the ALX 0x01 project: AirBnB Clone - Web Static! In this project, we'll be creating a simple static web page that emulates the basic functionality and design of the AirBnB website. This project is part of the ALX Full-Stack Software Engineering program to help you practice and demonstrate your HTML and CSS skills.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a static web page that resembles the AirBnB website. You'll be creating the main structure of the website, styling it to look similar to the AirBnB design, and adding placeholders for various sections like listings, search bars, and more. While the web page won't have any dynamic functionality, it will serve as a starting point for future development and can be expanded upon to include interactive features.

Customizing the Web Page
You can customize the web page by editing the index.html and styles.css files. Feel free to modify the HTML structure, add new sections, change colors, fonts, and more. You can also replace the placeholder images in the images/ directory with your own images.

Testing
To view your web page, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. You can also use browser developer tools to inspect and debug your page's HTML and CSS.
